# PlotSquared
For the end user, PlotSquared is packed with a tonne of cool features.
It allows you to merge plots, and build together with your friends. 
You can also change a lot of plot specific settings in the form of
flags. Such as: weather, time, gamemodes, pvp status. 

Whilst we provide a whole load of unique features, the biggest focus
is to provide a lag-free and smooth experience.

# Building
Gradle is the **recommended** way to build the project. Use `./gradlew build` in the main project directory to build the project. Gradle is required if you intend to build or develop the Sponge module.
If you prefer to use maven, a `pom.xml` file is provided for working with the Bukkit part of the plugin.
